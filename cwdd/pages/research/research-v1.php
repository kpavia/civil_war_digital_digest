                            to use it for Living History, you might want to look for a better cover to take into the field.<br>
                            Full of information about how the Army wanted things done, it is an excellent place to start. However, veterans will tell you not all went according to plane.

                            Bircher was a drummer in the 2nd Minnesota. It is said "An army travels on it's stomach" and Bircher is no exception. He writes about food a lot in his diary 
                            and in Episode 5, we made up one of the recipes.
